# C Programs For Everybody To Try!

_`Last Updated: April 25' 2021`_

## Introduction:

Here are programs that every budding programmer who is learning to code in C should start with. 
These programs are a compilation of many different types of programs and levels of programming you should try.
You can use the table in Order Of Programs file to find the order in which it is best to program in.

## Pre-Requisites:

1. A coding IDE or just use the CMD/Terminal on your Windows Pc/Mac respectively (I used VS Code for this).

2. Check that C/C++ Extension is properly installed in your system/VS Code and the Path to C/C++ is integratively set in your system.

3. Start by trying to create the program by yourself if you encounter any problems refer to the code in the program file, 
if the problem still persist then create a issue or use Google/Stack Overlflow for help.

4. Done! You have successfully created the program in C by your own.

Note: All the exe files are provided to make sure the program code runs when I create them (Tested on Windows 10).
